# GraphLeak

The GraphLeak provides a new dataset to locate and identify leaks in Water Distribution Systems through realistic simulations performed in EPANET-matlab-toolkit. 

GraphLeak consists of simulations in different scenarios and topologies designed under realistic hydraulic parameters where each node represents a measurement
point. 

### Evaluation

The results obtained by a Multi-layer Perceptron are evaluated by the ain classification metrics of confusion matrix, such as accuracy, precision, reacall and F1-score.

The Mean Absolute Error (MAPE) is used to analyze the error between predictions and the correct values.
